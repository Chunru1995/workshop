**Day 10: Group Presentations and Collective Collaboration**

Our final day will consist of two parts. In the first half of the session, each group will share their work using Shiny to turn one of the tools from this workshop into an interactive web application. In the second half of the session, we will work together to brainstorm ideas for integrating the pieces produced by the individual groups.
