**Day 4: Measuring and Mapping Using the American Community Survey**

In this module, we will learn how to use the `tidycensus` package to download and visualize data from the American Community Survey (ACS). We will focus on two skills in particular. First, we will learn how to depict uncertainty in ACS estimates using `ggplot` to plot both point estimates and confidence intervals. The confidence intervals in question are based on the margins of error included with the ACS data. As part of this exercise, we will see how to construct margins of error for derived quantities such as sums and proportions. Second, we will learn how to use `ggplot` to construct choropleth maps depciting the spatial distribution of values across a given set of geographies. This exercise will serve as an introduction to spatial data in general and `sf`-class objects in particular.

Though it only takes a few minutes to complete, students should sign-up for a Census API key prior to class using the following link: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
