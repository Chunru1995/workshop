Now that we can load data from a tabular file like Excel or CSV, we can start working with data in R. But raw data is never ready out of the box for the kinds of analyses we have in mind (and anyone who suggests otherwise is trying to sell you something). Today we'll cover the **tidyverse**, a powerful package in R for cleaning, wrangling, and manipulating data.

For the tidy data lab, in addition to the UNdata.csv file attached here, please download the V-Dem Core data file, version 13, here: https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/country-year-v-dem-core-v13/
