**Day 6: Network Analysis and Migration Flows**

In this module, we will learn how to use the `tidygraph` and `ggraph` packages to describe and visualize network data, which play a central in the study of globalization, as well as in the study of migration&mdash;a process that is often characterized in terms of the flow of indivduals across locales. After reviewing the basic properties of network data, we will learn how to use numbers to describe (a) the structure of a network as a whole and (b) the properties of the nodes making up the network question. In addition, we will learn how to identify subgroups of observations within a network. The discussion of network analysis will serve as general introduction to concepts that will appear again when we discuss exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial regression, both of which can be understood as special cases of network analysis in which the networks at hand are defined in terms of the spatial relationship between observations.
